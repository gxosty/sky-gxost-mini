# sky-gxost-mini
A cheat script (uncompleted) for game Sky:CoTL with auto offset finder

The goal of this project is to make script for the game Sky: Children of the Light that will automatically find offsets if possible. It will be developed and improved as much as we can and we hope it will really be useful in some cases. Currently, the project is in its alpha version.
